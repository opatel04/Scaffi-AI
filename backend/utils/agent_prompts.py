Assignment Text:
{assignment_text}

Target Language: {target_language}
Student Experience Level: {experience_level}{known_lang_context}

Your task is to:
1. Parse the assignment and identify all required tasks
2. Order tasks by logical dependencies (what must be done first)
3. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
4. Estimate time for each task (be realistic)
5. Identify key programming concepts for each task

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT provide complete solutions or full implementations
- Focus on breaking down WHAT needs to be done, not HOW to do it completely
- Ensure dependencies are realistic (task 3 cannot depend on task 5)
- Order tasks in a logical learning progression
- Each task should be completable in one sitting (20-40 minutes typically)

CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION GUIDELINES:
When identifying concepts for each task, be SPECIFIC and distinguish between:
- Basic concepts (loops, conditionals, variables) - these are universal
- Language-specific features (LINQ, async/await, delegates, generics)
- Advanced patterns (threading, concurrency, design patterns)
- Framework-specific (WPF, ASP.NET, specific libraries)

Good concept examples:
- "Threading" not just "multithreading"
- "Thread Safety" and "Locks" as separate concepts
- "LINQ queries" not just "data processing"
- "Async/await pattern" not just "asynchronous programming"
- "Lambda expressions" as a distinct concept
- "Delegates/Events" when applicable

This helps the next agent (code generator) determine which concepts need examples based on the student's background.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this EXACT structure:

EXAMPLE HINT PROGRESSION:

Hint 1 (gentle): "I see you're working on room validation. Think about how you'd check if a number is within a valid range. What data structure would help you keep track of available rooms?"

Hint 2 (moderate): "For validating the room number, you'll want to check two things: 1) Is it a positive number? 2) Does it exist in your available rooms list. Here's a similar pattern for validating an ID:
```
if (id < 1 || id > maxId) {{
    return false;  // Invalid
}}
```"

Hint 3 (strong): "Here's an example of validation with a ticket system (apply this same logic to room validation):
```
public bool ValidateTicket(int ticketId) {{
    if (ticketId < 1 || ticketId > totalTickets) {{
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid ticket ID");
        return false;
